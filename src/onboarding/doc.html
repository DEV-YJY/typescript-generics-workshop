# Overview of the development process and version control - For each sprint,
[development
tickets](https://dev.azure.com/datainsightnz/Di%20Footprint/_boards/board/t/Di%20Footprint%20Team/Backlog%20items)
are created based on the Product Backlog Items
([PBIs](https://dev.azure.com/datainsightnz/Di%20Footprint/_backlogs/backlog/Di%20Footprint%20Team/Backlog%20items))
in [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/datainsightnz) for each project. - Each
developer will be assigned a ticket to work on. Once you are assigned with the
task, change the task's user name to your name and save it as shown below: -
Data Insight uses GitHub as its version control platform ([GitHub
repository](https://github.com/datainsight-nz)). ### Getting started - Before
starting to add or edit code in a project, create a branch named "AB#" followed
by the task number you are working on from the relevant Azure Dev Ops Project
e.g : `git checkout -b "AB#178"` ### Committing work and submitting Pull
Requests Commit regularly when working on tasks, using the branch name at the
start of your commit message, followed by a detailed explanation of changes
made. e.g: `git commit -m "AB#178 Added margin to nav items to prevent them from
overlapping the logo"` For further info and tips on writing helpful commit
messages checkout
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/ When
the code is ready to be added to the main branch, commit your work as above and
push to the remote repository: `git push origin
<branch name
  >` Then submit a pull request from VS Code, using the GitHub Pull Request
  extension. Ensure you assign your manager to the pull request after submitting
  it. # Development Environment - OS: Windows - Programming languages:

  DI Footprint ### DI Nexus ## Setting Up DI projects locally #### Create a
  folder which will hold your local projects (C:\Development) ## DI Retain -
  Clone the DI Retain repository into your local projects folder by pasting the
  following into Powershell: `git clone
  https://github.com/datainsight-nz/di-retain.git` move to di-retain folder and

  nexus folder and open the project in VS Code `$ code .` - Follow instructions
  from README.md to get project running. # Code review ### Your code will be
  reviewed during the pull request review. Also, developers can always consult
  with a senior developer for a code feedback. # Performance evaluation and
  feedback processes ### Performance is to be formally evaluated in the
  quarterly review. However, a feedback on developers' performance will be given
  in their fortnightly catch-up with a senior developer # Career development and
  training opportunities ### This will be discussed individually with a senior
  developer in fortnightly catch-up # Additional useful resources - Building a
